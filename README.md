# Purchase Order Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing procurement workflows by analyzing purchase order data and identifying opportunities for cost savings and process efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Procurement teams often manage a high volume of purchase orders across multiple vendors and product lines. This project aims to streamline the PO process by analyzing order patterns, identifying inefficiencies, and recommending improvements.

## Approach

- **Template Setup**:
  - Used standardized PO templates for consistent data entry and reporting.
  - Validated fields such as order date, vendor ID, item cost, and delivery timeline.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Explored key procurement metrics: average lead time, vendor reliability, order volume trends.
  - Identified duplicate orders, pricing anomalies, and delivery delays.

- **Optimization**:
  - Developed logic to suggest optimal order quantities and timing.
  - Ranked vendors based on cost-effectiveness and delivery performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks / Python Scripts
- CSV Templates

## Learnings

- Standardized templates improve data integrity and analysis efficiency.
- Data-driven PO management can significantly reduce procurement costs.
- Vendor performance analytics supports better negotiation and sourcing decisions.

## Future Work

- Integrate the solution with ERP systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle) for real-time usage.
- Automate alerts for unusual pricing or order duplication.
- Extend to multi-location inventory and fulfillment planning.
